	<p>We are not violent.<br>
<br>We are citizens of the world who bear witness to tyranny, oppression and censorship.
<br>We are activists who seek to change the system and the cycle of corruption.
<br>We seek to create transparency in governments and all institutions of public service.
<br>We resist those who seek to violate our rights as human beings.
<br>As a collective of autonomous individuals however,
<br>WE HAVE NO LEADERS who dictate the methods of resistance.
<br>Some of us are indeed hackers, who use our skills to make critical information available to the public.
<br>Some of us organize protests and rallies.
<br>Some of us volunteer our time to feed those who can’t feed themselves.
<br>We are your neighbours, your friends, and your relatives.
<br>We prepare your food, repair your appliances, write your books, compose your music, and create your technology.
<br>We are your postal workers, barbers, store clerks and lawyers.
<br>We are socialists, capitalists, we are atheists and we are religious, WE ARE EVERYONE
and we are no one.
<br>NONE OF US ARE AS POWERFUL AS ALL OF US.
<br>United as One,
<br>Divided by Zero.
<br>WE ARE ANONYMOUS。
